# Family Wish List

Every holiday or birthday we always have the same problems:

- It is difficult to manage and communicate who is getting what for whom.
- Wish lists are scattered between emails, texts, etc.
- Notes/comments on gifts and gift ideas are scattered as well and get lost.
- It is difficult to keep track of what gifts you still need to buy.
- There is no good way to update your wish list after you send it.

FWL manages all this communication for you. When you view someone else's wish list you can mark
the items you plan on getting and see which items others plan to get or have gotten. Don't worry,
the owner of the wish list won't be able to see any of this so no surprises will be ruined. In
addition, all wish lists (including your own) will now be in one place making them easy to find,
access, read, and edit. You can make updates to your wish list and everyone will see your changes.
You can also add your gift ideas to other's with lists and add notes and comments to items on wish
lists to help whomever will be getting that item (coming soon). Again, the owner of the wish list
won't see a thing.

After marking some gifts that you plan to get, the home page displays your to-do list of gifts you
need to get. After you get them you can mark them as gotten. This will remove it from your to-do
list and let others know that you got that item.
